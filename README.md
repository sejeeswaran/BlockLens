# BlockLens
BlockLens is an AI-powered forensic system that detects whether an image is real, AI-generated, AI-edited, or a screenshot — without relying on any database. Using multi-model intelligence, Google Gemini as the expert oracle, and blockchain for immutable verification, BlockLens makes digital authenticity transparent, verifiable, and future-proof.
